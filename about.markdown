<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Note: </b>I am actively seeking full-time roles as a Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I am currently enrolled in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Master’s program at the University of Delaware and will be graduating in May 2025.<br/> For my master’s thesis, I am exploring reinforcement learning-based solutions for hardware security.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">During the summer of 2024, I am working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.mbd.xyz/">Mbd.xyz</a>, focusing on deploying LLMs on AOS using ONNXRuntime and bridging recommendation system algorithms. Additionally, as a personal project, I am investigating the use of large language models (LLMs) to better structure qualitative data on Indian capital markets.
</p>


 <p style="text-align:justify">Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at a startup called Ederlabs for 2.5 years. Additionally, I was also a core contributor to <a href="https://openmined.org/">OpenMined's</a> <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft">PySyft</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/SyMPC">SyMPC</a> projects. I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020. </p>


<p style="text-align:justify">I have a keen interest in developing and scaling learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. My experience includes working with language models, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I am passionate about leveraging my knowledge and experience in software engineering and machine learning to develop systems that facilitate the building, management, and deployment of impactful learning algorithms. </p>
<p>My time as a software engineer at a startup has taught me standard software engineering practices and helped me gain substantial DevOps knowledge. In addition to my work experience, I have contributed to open-source software, which has taught me to navigate and dive deep into large codebases. As a former core contributor to a research-based open-source software project, I have also gained experience in implementing research papers from scratch.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My experience working in a startup and contributing to open source has taught me to work independently. I can take up tasks and complete them end-to-end with minimal assistance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Apart from technical interests and work, I am curious about several things and spend time reading about various topics. I am especially interested in capital markets and business. I closely follow the Indian markets and invest using fundamental analysis. </p>

<p>The second man to walk on the moon once saw a presentation of mine :P </p>
